        <h5>Role: Mother's Level Lead</h5>
        <h5>Platform: Unreal, Blueprints</h5>

        <p>
            Changeling is a narrative mystery game for VR. I and two others were tasked with taking the fairly finished
            Mother's Level to a state of near completion over the summer; I was the primary point of communication
            between the project director, Elouise Oyzon, and my fellow leads for the other levels.

        <ul>
            <li>
                I made the blueprints for the antagonistic force of the mother's level; the anim BP for the shadowy hand
                with custom duration and position for its inverse kinematics, the BP for communicating with the level
                blueprint at large about that hand's state, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                I delved deep into the Niagara particle system for the first time, making a towering cumulonimbus-shaped
                mass of black fog using a custom module and trigonometry functions
            </li>
            <li>
                Despite lack of ability to set a beam particle system's source <em>and</em> target to actors, I
                discovered a way to link both ends of the player's tether beams to moving, dynamic locations, without
                the beam having to "catch up" to either regardless of their speed
            </li>
        </ul>
