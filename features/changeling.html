        <p>
            Changeling is a narrative mystery game for VR. I and two others were tasked with taking the half-finished
            Mother's Level to a state of near completion over the summer; I was the primary point of communication
            between the project director, Elouise Oyzon, and my fellow leads for the other levels.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                I made the blueprints for the antagonistic force of the mother's level; for example, the anim BP for a
                shadowy hand with a parameterized duration and position for its inverse kinematics.
            </li>
            <li>
                I delved deep into the Niagara particle system for the first time, making a towering cumulonimbus-shaped
                mass of black fog using a custom module and trigonometry functions
            </li>
            <li>
                Despite lack of ability to set a beam particle system's source <em>and</em> target to actors, I
                discovered a way to link both ends of the player's tether beams to moving, dynamic locations, without
                the beam having to "catch up" to either regardless of their speed
            </li>
        </ul>
