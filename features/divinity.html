            <p>
                Divinity is a fantasy story series about gods, angels, demons, and the war between
                them.
                <strong>I write it in my spare time out of passion.</strong> Divinity was initially
                conceived some time in 2012, and it's grown just as much as I have since.
                <strong>
                    I built this website from the ground up so I could put Divinity's chapters
                    online, to share them with others more easily.
                </strong>
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        I got fed up with the lack of customization I had on WordPress and other
                        website builders,
                    </strong>
                    so using my designs from those sites as my specification,
                    <strong>I built this website starting from an empty html file.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I didn't want to copy and paste my work into the website every time I updated a
                    chapter, so I embedded the source google doc into the site.
                    <strong>
                        While trying to figure out how to style that embedded doc with CSS, I
                        discovered a way to extract that doc's contents and insert it into the
                        website by itself with a CORS request;
                    </strong>
                    this allows for live updates <em>and</em> full freedom with CSS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I added Bookmark and Light/Dark mode buttons, programmed with JavaScript, to
                    make reading as convenient as I could for visitors.
                </li>
