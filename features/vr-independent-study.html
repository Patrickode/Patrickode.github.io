        <p>
            In the fall semester of my junior year, I participated in an independent study
            focused on experimental gameplay in VR.
            <strong>
                The goal was to create prototypes centered around experimental or interesting
                methods of interfacing with VR,
            </strong>
            then determining what works, what doesn't work, and whether they would be worth
            further development.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our final task was to create a website showcasing our prototypes;</strong>
            you can visit that website, play my prototypes, and see the source code by clicking
            the link below.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                One of my prototype ideas involved prohibiting players from looking at things
                they needed to see.
                <strong>
                    I did this by making the player a thief who has to steal valuables with only
                    their peripheral vision,
                </strong>
                or their eye camera will catch them red-handed.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To do that, I gave each object a "home"—a box trigger—that invokes an
                        event whenever the object leaves it. From here,
                        <strong>
                            if the displaced object ever enters the player's primary cone of
                            vision—another camera within the main camera, with a lower FOV—an
                            alarm goes off.
                        </strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I wanted to sound the alarm if the player saw an object missing from its
                        home, but I didn't have time. To get that working, I would have to make
                        "seeing" an object percentage based, instead of just being "seen" or
                        "not seen".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    My final prototype was also my best one, because it was so simple.
                </strong>
                Building on the "be careful where you look" concept from the eye-camera thief
                prototype, I made a game where your face and hands are constantly shooting
                deadly lasers and
                <strong>
                    you have to fend off enemy dummies without hurting friendly ones. It's
                    surprisingly challenging; It's easy to hit an innocent dummy if you look
                    around too carelessly.
                </strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
