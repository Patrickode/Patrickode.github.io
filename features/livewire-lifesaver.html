            <p>
                Livewire Lifesaver is an enhanced version of my first attempt at the Ludum Dare
                Compo, for Ludum Dare 46.
                <strong>
                    I was experimenting with a velocity-based movement system on a spherical player
                    before the compo, and I liked it so much I decided to do something with it in
                    the compo.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I revisited Livewire Lifesaver the following summer to polish it a little, but I
                was so satisfied with my improvements on the movement that I made it a larger
                project.
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I noticed that moving against a wall while falling slowed the player's descent.
                    I thought this would be fun, so I made it a full mechanic;
                    <strong>
                        I used vector math to adjust the player's velocity when moving against a
                        wall to allow wall-running, wall-climbing, and wall-jumping.
                    </strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I added timers that deaden input when doing each of these, giving the
                            player some leeway and ensuring a smooth, human-friendly experience
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>The current automatically follows wire pieces,</strong> without needing
                    a direct, developer-assigned reference to them;
                    <strong>
                        this saves a ton of tedium and makes level creation as simple as drag and
                        drop.
                    </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wanted to learn Unity's new input system, so
                    <strong>
                        I reverse-engineered and customized the code from Unity's interactive
                        rebinding demo;
                    </strong>
                    this allowed for controller support and custom control schemes that are
                    preserved between play sessions
                </li>
            </ul>
