        <h4>Livewire Lifesaver</h4>
        <h5>Role: Sole Developer</h5>
        <h5>Platform: Unity, C#</h5>

        <p>
            Livewire Lifesaver is an enhanced version of my first attempt at the Ludum Dare
            Compo, for Ludum Dare 46.
            <strong>
                I was experimenting with a velocity-based movement system on a spherical player
                before the compo, and I liked it so much I decided to do something with it in
                the compo.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I revisited Livewire Lifesaver the following summer to polish it a little, but I
            was so satisfied with my improvements on the movement that I made it a larger
            project.

                I noticed that moving against a wall while falling slowed the player's descent.
                I thought this would be fun, so I made it a full mechanic;
                <strong>
                    I used vector math to adjust the player's velocity when moving against a
                    wall to allow wall-running, wall-climbing, and wall-jumping.
                </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I added timers that deaden input when doing each of these, giving the
                        player some leeway and ensuring a smooth, human-friendly experience
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The current automatically follows wire pieces,</strong> without needing
                a direct, developer-assigned reference to them;
                <strong>
                    this saves a ton of tedium and makes level creation as simple as drag and
                    drop.
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                I wanted to learn Unity's new input system, so
                <strong>
                    I reverse-engineered and customized the code from Unity's interactive
                    rebinding demo;
                </strong>
                this allowed for controller support and custom control schemes that are
                preserved between play sessions
            </li>
        </ul>
