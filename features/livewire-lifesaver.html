        <h5>Platform: Unity, C#</h5>

        <p>
            Livewire Lifesaver is an enhanced version of my first attempt at the Ludum Dare
            Compo, for Ludum Dare 46.
            <strong>
                I was experimenting with a velocity-based movement system on a spherical player
                before the compo, and I liked it so much I decided to do something with it in
                the compo.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I revisited Livewire Lifesaver the following summer to polish it a little, but I
            was so satisfied with my improvements on the movement that I made it a larger
            project.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                I noticed that moving against a wall while falling slowed the player's descent.
                I thought this would be fun, so I made it a full mechanic;
                <strong>
                    I used vector math to adjust the player's velocity when moving against a
                    wall to allow wall-running, wall-climbing, and wall-jumping.
                </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I added timers that deaden input when doing each of these, giving the
                        player some leeway and ensuring a smooth, human-friendly experience
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The current automatically follows wire pieces,</strong> without needing
                a direct, developer-assigned reference to them;
                <strong>
                    this saves a ton of tedium and makes level creation as simple as drag and
                    drop.
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                I wanted to learn Unity's new input system, so
                <strong>
                    I reverse-engineered and customized the code from Unity's interactive
                    rebinding demo;
                </strong>
                this allowed for controller support and custom control schemes that are
                preserved between play sessions
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Divinity is a fantasy story series about gods, angels, demons, and the war between
            them.
            <strong>I write it in my spare time out of passion.</strong> Divinity was initially
            conceived some time in 2012, and it's grown just as much as I have since.
            <strong>
                I built this website from the ground up so I could put Divinity's chapters
                online, to share them with others more easily.
            </strong>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    I got fed up with the lack of customization I had on WordPress and other
                    website builders,
                </strong>
                so using my designs from those sites as my specification,
                <strong>I built this website starting from an empty html file.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                I didn't want to copy and paste my work into the website every time I updated a
                chapter, so I embedded the source google doc into the site.
                <strong>
                    While trying to figure out how to style that embedded doc with CSS, I
                    discovered a way to extract that doc's contents and insert it into the
                    website by itself with a CORS request;
                </strong>
                this allows for live updates <em>and</em> full freedom with CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
                I added Bookmark and Light/Dark mode buttons, programmed with JavaScript, to
                make reading as convenient as I could for visitors.
            </li>
        </ul>
