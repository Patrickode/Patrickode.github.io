										Changeling is a narrative mystery game for VR. I and two others were tasked with
										taking the half-finished Mother's Level to a state of near completion over the
										summer; I was the primary point of communication between the project director,
										Elouise Oyzon, and my fellow leads for the other levels.

											I made the blueprints for the antagonistic force of the mother's level; for
											example, the anim BP for a shadowy hand with a parameterized duration and
											position for its inverse kinematics.
										</li>
										<li>
											I delved deep into the Niagara particle system for the first time, making a
											towering cumulonimbus-shaped mass of black fog using a custom module and
											trigonometry functions
										</li>

											Despite lack of ability to set a beam particle system's source <em>and</em>
											target to actors, I discovered a way to link both ends of the player's
											tether beams to moving, dynamic locations, without the beam having to "catch
											up" to either regardless of their speed

									<p>
										In the fall semester of my junior year, I participated in an independent study
										focused on experimental gameplay in VR.
										<strong>
											The goal was to create prototypes centered around experimental or
											interesting methods of interfacing with VR,
										</strong>
										then determining what works, what doesn't work, and whether they would be worth
										further development.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>
											Our final task was to create a website showcasing our prototypes;
										</strong>
										you can visit that website, play my prototypes, and see the source code by
										clicking the link below.
									</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											One of my prototype ideas involved prohibiting players from looking at
											things they needed to see.
											<strong>
												I did this by making the player a thief who has to steal valuables with
												only their peripheral vision,
											</strong>
											or their eye camera will catch them red-handed.
											<ul>
												<li>
													To do that, I gave each object a "home"—a box trigger—that invokes
													an event whenever the object leaves it. From here,
													<strong>
														if the displaced object ever enters the player's primary cone of
														vision—another camera within the main camera, with a lower
														FOV—an alarm goes off.
													</strong>
												</li>
												<li>
													I wanted to sound the alarm if the player saw an object missing from
													its home, but I didn't have time. To get that working, I would have
													to make "seeing" an object percentage based, instead of just being
													"seen" or "not seen".
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>
												My final prototype was also my best one, because it was so simple.
											</strong>
											Building on the "be careful where you look" concept from the eye-camera
											thief prototype, I made a game where your face and hands are constantly
											shooting deadly lasers and
											<strong>
												you have to fend off enemy dummies without hurting friendly ones. It's
												surprisingly challenging; It's easy to hit an innocent dummy if you look
												around too carelessly.
											</strong>
										</li>

										Livewire Lifesaver is an enhanced version of my first attempt at the Ludum Dare
										Compo, for Ludum Dare 46.
										<strong>
											I was experimenting with a velocity-based movement system on a spherical
											player before the compo, and I liked it so much I decided to do something
											with it in the compo.
										</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										I revisited Livewire Lifesaver the following summer to polish it a little, but I
										was so satisfied with my improvements on the movement that I made it a larger
										project.
									</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											I noticed that moving against a wall while falling slowed the player's
											descent. I thought this would be fun, so I made it a full mechanic;
											<strong>
												I used vector math to adjust the player's velocity when moving against a
												wall to allow wall-running, wall-climbing, and wall-jumping.
											</strong>
											<ul>
												<li>
													I added timers that deaden input when doing each of these, giving
													the
													player some leeway and ensuring a smooth, human-friendly experience
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>The current automatically follows wire pieces,</strong> without
											needing a direct, developer-assigned reference to them;
											<strong>
												this saves a ton of tedium and makes level creation as simple as drag
												and drop.
											</strong>
										</li>
										<li>
											I wanted to learn Unity's new input system, so
											<strong>
												I reverse-engineered and customized the code from Unity's interactive
												rebinding demo;
											</strong>
											this allowed for controller support and custom control schemes that are
											preserved between play sessions

										Divinity is a fantasy story series about gods, angels, demons, and the war
										between them.
										<strong>I write it in my spare time out of passion.</strong> Divinity was
										initially conceived some time in 2012, and it's grown just as much as I have
										since.
										<strong>
											I built this website from the ground up so I could put Divinity's chapters
											online, to share them with others more easily.
										</strong>
									</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>
												I got fed up with the lack of customization I had on WordPress and other
												website builders,
											</strong>
											so using my designs from those sites as my specification,
											<strong>I built this website starting from an empty html file.</strong>
										</li>
										<li>
											I didn't want to copy and paste my work into the website every time I
											updated a chapter, so I embedded the source google doc into the site.
											<strong>
												While trying to figure out how to style that embedded doc with CSS, I
												discovered a way to extract that doc's contents and insert it into the
												website by itself with a CORS request;
											</strong>
											this allows for live updates <em>and</em> full freedom with CSS.
										</li>
										<li>
											I added Bookmark and Light/Dark mode buttons, programmed with JavaScript, to
											make reading as convenient as I could for visitors.
