								<h4>Experimental VR Independent Study</h4>
								<h5>Role: Experimenter</h5>
								<h5>Platform: Unity, SteamVR, C#</h5>

								<p>
									In the fall semester of my junior year, I participated in an independent study
									focused on experimental gameplay in VR.
									<strong>
										The goal was to create prototypes centered around experimental or interesting
										methods of interfacing with VR,
									</strong>
									then determining what works, what doesn't work, and whether they would be worth
									further development.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Our final task was to create a website showcasing our prototypes;</strong>
									you can visit that website, play my prototypes, and see the source code by clicking
									the link below.
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>
										One of my prototype ideas involved prohibiting players from looking at things
										they needed to see.
										<strong>
											I did this by making the player a thief who has to steal valuables with only
											their peripheral vision,
										</strong>
										or their eye camera will catch them red-handed.
										<ul>
											<li>
												To do that, I gave each object a "home"—a box trigger—that invokes an
												event whenever the object leaves it. From here,
												<strong>
													if the displaced object ever enters the player's primary cone of
													vision—another camera within the main camera, with a lower FOV—an
													alarm goes off.
												</strong>
											</li>
											<li>
												I wanted to sound the alarm if the player saw an object missing from its
												home, but I didn't have time. To get that working, I would have to make
												"seeing" an object percentage based, instead of just being "seen" or
												"not seen".
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>
											My final prototype was also my best one, because it was so simple.
										</strong>
										Building on the "be careful where you look" concept from the eye-camera thief
										prototype, I made a game where your face and hands are constantly shooting
										deadly lasers and
										<strong>
											you have to fend off enemy dummies without hurting friendly ones. It's
											surprisingly challenging; It's easy to hit an innocent dummy if you look
											around too carelessly.
										</strong>
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Livewire Lifesaver</h4>
								<h5>Role: Sole Developer</h5>
								<h5>Platform: Unity, C#</h5>

								<p>
									Livewire Lifesaver is an enhanced version of my first attempt at the Ludum Dare
									Compo, for Ludum Dare 46.
									<strong>
										I was experimenting with a velocity-based movement system on a spherical player
										before the compo, and I liked it so much I decided to do something with it in
										the compo.
									</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									I revisited Livewire Lifesaver the following summer to polish it a little, but I
									was so satisfied with my improvements on the movement that I made it a larger
									project.
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>
										I noticed that moving against a wall while falling slowed the player's descent.
										I thought this would be fun, so I made it a full mechanic;
										<strong>
											I used vector math to adjust the player's velocity when moving against a
											wall to allow wall-running, wall-climbing, and wall-jumping.
										</strong>
										<ul>
											<li>
												I added timers that deaden input when doing each of these, giving the
												player some leeway and ensuring a smooth, human-friendly experience
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>The current automatically follows wire pieces,</strong> without needing
										a direct, developer-assigned reference to them;
										<strong>
											this saves a ton of tedium and makes level creation as simple as drag and
											drop.
										</strong>
									</li>
									<li>
										I wanted to learn Unity's new input system, so
										<strong>
											I reverse-engineered and customized the code from Unity's interactive
											rebinding demo;
										</strong>
										this allowed for controller support and custom control schemes that are
										preserved between play sessions
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Divinity Story Hub</h4>
								<h5>Role: Sole Developer</h5>
								<h5>Platform: HTML, CSS, Jekyll, JavaScript</h5>

								<p>
									Divinity is a fantasy story series about gods, angels, demons, and the war between
									them.
									<strong>I write it in my spare time out of passion.</strong> Divinity was initially
									conceived some time in 2012, and it's grown just as much as I have since.
									<strong>
										I built this website from the ground up so I could put Divinity's chapters
										online, to share them with others more easily.
									</strong>
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>
											I got fed up with the lack of customization I had on WordPress and other
											website builders,
										</strong>
										so using my designs from those sites as my specification,
										<strong>I built this website starting from an empty html file.</strong>
									</li>
									<li>
										I didn't want to copy and paste my work into the website every time I updated a
										chapter, so I embedded the source google doc into the site.
										<strong>
											While trying to figure out how to style that embedded doc with CSS, I
											discovered a way to extract that doc's contents and insert it into the
											website by itself with a CORS request;
										</strong>
										this allows for live updates <em>and</em> full freedom with CSS.
									</li>
									<li>
										I added Bookmark and Light/Dark mode buttons, programmed with JavaScript, to
										make reading as convenient as I could for visitors.
									</li>
